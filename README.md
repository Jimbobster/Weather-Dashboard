# Weather-Dashboard

## Description
My challenge was to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser, and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

I retrieved the 5 day weather forecast data from openweathermap.org.

When a user searches for a city, they are presented with current and future conditions for that city. The chosen city is also added to the search history and stored locally, to be viewed again by clicking on the name of the city.

When you enter a city into the search box, then the current weather conditions for the city are shown. The information that is visible will be:
<ul>
 <li>The city name
 <li>The date
 <li>The temperature
 <li>The humidity
 <li>The wind speed
 <li>The sunrise and sunset times
 <li>An icon for the current weather state
</ul>

Below the current day's weather, you are also presented with a 5 day forecast that displays : 

<ul>
 <li>The date
 <li>The temperature
 <li>The humidity
 <li>A weather icon displaying the predicted weather for that day
</ul>

When you click on a city in the search history, you will be presented with the current and future conditions for that city.
